# Lottery Ticket Generator and Scorer

This Python project utilizes data models trained on historical winning lottery drawings to generate potential tickets and score them based on past patterns. The goal is to provide insights into patterns from previous draws, but it is important to note that this project **does not** predict future winning numbers. Any appearance of success is purely coincidental, and this project does not claim to influence the outcome of any lottery drawing.

## Features:
- **Ticket Generation**: The project generates lottery tickets using data models trained on winning drawings.
- **Scoring System**: Generated tickets are scored based on the historical data and model predictions, allowing for comparison of ticket viability.
- **Top 5 Display**: The top 5 tickets are displayed based on their scores, giving users an overview of the best-performing generated tickets.
- **Persistence**: The application saves generated tickets and scores, allowing the program to be stopped and restarted without losing progress.

## Disclaimer:
The project is developed with an understanding of random drawing principles and game theory. The generated tickets are random in nature, and the project does not claim to have any ability to predict winning lottery numbers. Any alignment with actual winning numbers is entirely by chance.

## Setup and Usage:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Run the main script to generate and score tickets.
